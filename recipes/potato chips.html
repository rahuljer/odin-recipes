    <h1>Description :</h1>
    <p> Nearly impossible to resist and more often than not potato chips come in near-bottomless bags that are equally impossible to put down,
         and before you know it you've consumed an entire meal's worth of calories. A minuscule 1-ounce portion of potato chips will run you 160 calories and 10 grams of fat. 
         But why should we have to avoid snacks entirely? But why can't there be room in our healthy diets for snacks? You haven't failed at eating healthy if you get hungry between meals, and when you're hungry it is generally considered healthy to, well…eat.
          But, why settle when you can bake healthier and immensely tastier chips in 20 minutes at home? Customize their flavor depending on your mood.</p>
    </p>Just boil the water, add the tastemaker and noodles and your maggi is ready within 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>2 large russet potatoes</ul>
    <ul>1 Tbsp olive oil</ul>
    <ul>Salt and black pepper to taste</ul>

    <ul>2 Tbsp finely grated Parmesan</ul>
    <ul>1⁄2 Tbsp smoked paprika</ul>
    <ul>1 Tbsp chopped fresh rosemary</ul>
    <ul>1 clove garlic, minced</ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>

        Scrub the potatoes with cold water and cut crosswise into 1⁄8 thick slices.
        Toss with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
        Spread in a single layer on a baking sheet. (To use the optional toppings: Sprinkle with Parmesan, paprika, or rosemary before baking; add the parsley mixture after baking.)
